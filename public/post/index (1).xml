      <description>We often look at the structures that have survived from antiquity and marvel at the skill of their builders. Let me offer a more dissapointing take: Most of what antiquity build fell down, burned, or has by other means long sice succumed to the elements.
Or share Cassidy&amp;rsquo;s anecdote about falling cathedrals.
Materials fail when their structural limts are surpassed as sure as water boils at 100-degrees Celcius. I want to extend this metaphor into writing and communication in general.</description>

      <description>During a typical data munge I will frequenly transition a dataset back and forth between long and wide formats by using the gather() and spread() functions of tidyr. Sometimes I encounter an error message after trying to spread data that previously gathered without issue: “Error: Duplicate identifiers for rows …”.
I’ll attempt to clarify the conditions that give rise to this error so that you can resolve it.
Let’s start by taking some familiar data and making it very small for demo purposes.</description>
