We often look at the structures that have survived from antiquity and marvel at the skill of their builders. Let me offer a more dissapointing take: Most of what antiquity build fell down, burned, or has by other means long sice succumed to the elements. 

Or share Cassidy's anecdote about falling cathedrals. 

Materials fail when their structural limts are surpassed as sure as water boils at 100-degrees Celcius. I want to extend this metaphor into writing and communication in general. Your writing fails when you exceed the structural limits of your material. Your material is not the paragraph or a slide. Your material is your audience's attention span. The limits of paragraphs and slides are the limits of your audience's attention span. If your audience can handle more, by all means, load it up. But do not think for a second you can make safe assumptions about the carrying capacity of slides or paragraphs. These are buckets that must refelect your audiences' capacity. 

Great communicators use tools and techniques that leverage less time to communicate more. Just like an arch or a truss, a well designed talk can support mre material with less structure if the right structure is chosen, but ultimately the successful builder and speaker must make the same compromise: Increase carrying capacity or lighten the load. We too rarely choose the latter. 

I have seen Jaime Penebaker mesmerize and audience of hundreds with not a single visual, and I have seen the most advanced slide fail because it exceeded its audience. Build within the limits of your techniques and materials and your building will succeed, Exceed those limits and you will fail as sure as water will boil at 100-degrees.
